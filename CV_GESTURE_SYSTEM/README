✋ Hand Gesture Recognition + Air Writing System
Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition and Air Writing System built using MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Google Colab (HTML + JavaScript integration).
This project allows users to detect hand gestures, add custom gestures dynamically, and write in the air using finger tracking.


🚀 Project Overview
This system uses MediaPipe Hand Tracking to detect 21 hand landmarks in real time.
It supports:
✋ Real-time hand landmark detection
➕ Adding custom gestures dynamically
🔍 Gesture recognition
✍️ Air writing using index finger
📷 Webcam support inside Google Colab


🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
MediaPipe
OpenCV
NumPy
HTML + JavaScript (inside Colab)
Google Colab

⚙️ Installation & Setup
Step 1: Open in Google Colab
Upload CV_GESTURE_SYSTEM.ipynb to Google Colab.
Step 2: Install Required Libraries
!pip install mediapipe opencv-python numpy
Step 3: Run All Cells
Allow browser camera permission when prompted.
Webcam will start automatically.


🧠 How It Works
1️⃣ Hand Detection
MediaPipe detects 21 hand landmarks./
Landmark coordinates are extracted frame-by-frame.
2️⃣ Add Gesture      
Click "Add Gesture"
Current landmarks are captured
Assign a name to the gesture
Gesture stored in memory
3️⃣ Gesture Recognition
Live landmarks compared with stored gestures
If matched, gesture name displayed
4️⃣ Air Writing
Index finger tip tracked
Movement drawn on virtual canvas
Reset option available


🎯 Features
✔ Real-time gesture detection
✔ Custom gesture storage
✔ Air writing functionality
✔ Fully runs in browser (Colab)
✔ No external API required


📈 Future Improvements
Save gestures to file (JSON/database)
Add ML classifier for better accuracy
Multi-hand support
Deploy as web app
Add gesture-based system controls


⚠️ Known Issues
Camera permission must be allowed
Works best in good lighting
Single-hand support optimized
